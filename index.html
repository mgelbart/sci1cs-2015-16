		<b>Homework collaboration policy:</b><br>
		You are welcome to discuss assignments with others, but the assignments you submit must be entirely your own work. Here are some things that are OK and not OK:
		<ul>
		<li><font color="green">OK:</font> Discussing concepts, or how to approach an assignment with your classmates or others (e.g., "Hey, do you think we need to use a nested loop for this assignment?").</li>
		<li><font color="green">OK:</font> Discussing Python syntax with your classmates or others, or on Piazza (e.g., "Hey, what is the command for generating a random number between 0 and 1?")</li>
		<li><font color="green">OK:</font> Showing your terminal window to a classmate or Piazza and seeking advice based on the output and/or error message your assignment code produced.</li>
		<li><font color="green">OK:</font> Having the instructor or TA look at your code for an assignment and give help or suggestions.</li>
		<li><font color="green">OK:</font> Typing code on someone else's laptop in order to demonstrate a concept, so long as this code (or any derivative or modified version of this code) is not later submitted as part of an assignment.</li>
		<li><font color="red">NOT OK:</font> Typing code on someone else's computer (or having someone type on yours) and then submitting this code as part of an assignment.</li>
		<li><font color="red">NOT OK:</font> Looking at a classmate's code for an assignment (or having a classmate look at yours).</li>
		<li><font color="red">NOT OK:</font> Sending/receiving any amount of code for an assignment to/from someone else by email, Facebook, or any other means.</li>
		<li><font color="red">NOT OK:</font> Posting assignment solution code on Piazza.</li>
		<li><font color="red">NOT OK:</font> Having a discussion with someone about an assignment within the limits of what is allowed by this collaboration policy, but then not listing this person's name in your assignment submission (see "Homework submission instructions" below).</li>
		</ul>

		If you are caught cheating, the penalty is typically suspension from the University. Please don't do it! If you are struggling to the point that you are tempted to cheat, please come talk to one of us and we will work through the situation. We are here to support you, but there are 75 of you and sometimes we need your help identifying where and when our support is most needed.
		</p>

		<b>Homework submission instructions:</b>
		<ol>
		<li>Make sure there is a comment at the top of EVERY Python file you are submitting, containing:
		<ul><li>your first name</li>
		    <li>your last name</li>
		    <li>your UBC student number</li>
		    <li>a list of everyone you discussed the assignment with, including classmates (first and last name), TAs, instructors, anyone else</li>
		    <li>(optional) the amount of time you spent working on the program</li>
		    </ul> </li>
		<li>Make sure the name(s) of your file(s) EXACTLY match the name(s) asked for in the assignment.
		<li>Go to www.connect.ubc.ca</li>
		<li>Sign in with your CWL</li>
		<li>Navigate to Science One Computer Science (not the general Science One page)</li>
		<li>Click on the assignment you are submitting</li>
		<li>Click on Browse My Computer and attach all relevant files, one by one</li>
		<li>Press Submit</li>
		</ol>
		Note that you will be unable to sumbit assignments on Connect once the submission deadline has passed.

			<h1>Grading</h1>
			<p>The computer science component is worth 6% of your overall Science One grade. The tentative breakdown for this grade is as follows: assignments (2%), Term 1 exam (2%), Term 2 exam (2%). The instructor reserves the right to change this grading scheme at any point during the course.</p>
